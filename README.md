## ⚙️ How the Data Was Created

The dataset was generated using Python to simulate realistic network activity:

- **Source & destination IPs**  
- **Packet sizes (100–1500 bytes)**  
- **Protocols (TCP / UDP)**  
- **Threat scores (0–100 scale)**  
- **Timestamps across 30+ days**

Each row represents one network event.
